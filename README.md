# Cybersecurity Home Lab Portfolio

This repository documents a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs designed to simulate real-world defensive and offensive security workflows. The labs focus on building practical skills used by security analysts and engineers, including threat detection, monitoring, network and endpoint analysis, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, and incident response.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate structured analytical thinking, sound security methodology, and the ability to investigate, document, and respond to security events across multiple environments.

This repository is updated as labs are completed and techniques are explored over time.

## Lab Focus Areas

### Defensive Security (Blue Team)
- Security monitoring and alert triage
- Log analysis 
- Network traffic analysis 
- Endpoint behavior and process analysis
- Threat intelligence and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Vulnerability assessment and risk prioritization
- Incident response lifecycle and reporting

### Offensive Security
- Vulnerability discovery and enumeration
- Exploitation techniques
- Post-exploitation concepts
- Adversary behavior simulation
- Attack–defense correlation and detection validation

---

## Lab Structure

Each lab follows a consistent documentation format to mirror professional security workflows:

- Objective and scope
- Tools and techniques used
- Observations and analysis
- Analyst assessment and conclusions
- Recommended actions or mitigation
- Supporting evidence (screenshots, logs, or artifacts)

This structure emphasizes decision-making and investigation methodology rather than tool-specific walkthroughs.

## Notes

This repository is intended to showcase practical cybersecurity skills and investigative workflows. The emphasis is on understanding attacker behavior, detecting and analyzing malicious activity, and applying appropriate response actions based on risk and impact.
